# Net-Pay-Project-1

**COSC 501/AIT 500 at Towson University**

This is the assignment the project was created for: 
 
Make sure that you document the programs (add comments!) and use proper style (indent!) Read the guideline posted on our class website.  
 
Write a C++ program that calculates and prints the monthly paycheck for an employee. 

The net pay is calculated after taking the following deductions:      
- Federal income tax  = 15%      
- State income tax    =  5%      
- Social security tax =  5%      
- Medicare/Medicaid   =  3%      
- Pension plan        =  8%      
- Health insurance    = $125.00  

Your program should ask the user to input the employee ID,  and the earnings (gross amount) for current month. The output should be the net pay, after deductions. Format the output to have 2 decimal places.  

Sample output: 
Employee ID:                     12345  

- EARNINGS                      $4500.00  
- Federal Tax                     675.00  
- State Tax                       225.00  
- Social Security                 225.00  
- Medicare/Medicaid               135.00  
- Pension Plan                    360.00  
- Health Insurance                125.00  
  
NET PAY                       $2755.00  

NOTE: Use setw( ) to get the tabular alignment.  


It's a fairly basic assignement designed to get us used to what computers can do and the like :)
