# Net-Pay-Project-1

This is the assignment the project was created for 

COSC 501/AIT 500 Project  1                              Due:  Sept  23, 2013 
 
Make sure that you document the programs (add comments!) and use proper style (indent!) Read the guideline posted on our class website.  
 
Write a C++ program that calculates and prints the monthly paycheck for an employee. 
The net pay is calculated after taking the following deductions:      
Federal income tax  = 15%      State income tax    =  5%      Social security tax =  5%      Medicare/Medicaid   =  3%      Pension plan        =  8%      Health insurance    = $125.00  

Your program should ask the user to input the employee ID,  and the earnings (gross amount) for current month. The output should be the net pay, after deductions. Format the output to have 2 decimal places.  

Sample output: 
Employee ID:                     12345

State Tax                       225.00
